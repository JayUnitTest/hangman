# Hangman

## An AiCore Project

### What is Hangman?:
    Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

### Project: What is it exactly? 
    This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. Not too unlike what you might remember playing when you were younger... just with the modern twist 

### Project: Aims of the project 
    The primary goal of this project is to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired during my studies with AiCore to create a comprehensive and practical project. No better way to see what you've learnt and to consolidate that learning, than making a fun game!
