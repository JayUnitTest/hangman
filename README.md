## __An AiCore Project__

### __What is Hangman?:__
 Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This look familiar?:

### __What is this project?__
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. Not too unlike what you might remember playing when you were younger... just with the modern twist 

### __Aims of the project__
The primary goal of this project is to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired during my studies with AiCore to create a comprehensive and practical project. No better way to see what you've learnt and to consolidate that learning, than making a fun game! 

### Installation:
To play this version of hangman, simply clone this repository. Once cloned you can then either run the file directly through your IDE pressing shift+enter or through the terminal by navigating to the project directory and running the script with python

like so:

    hangman/milestone_5.py
